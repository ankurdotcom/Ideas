POS Application Requirements and Features
1. Core Business Flow:

Token Counter (Order Placement): Customers place orders at the token counter. They receive a short-lived OTP and optionally a QR Code if they provide a phone number.
Sales/Delivery Counter (Order Fulfillment): Salespersons either scan the customer's QR code or manually enter the OTP to retrieve the order and mark it as fulfilled, partially delivered, or refunded.
Dual Screen Setup: Both the customer and the salesperson see the order on two screens. The customer's view is read-only, while the salesperson can edit.
2. Authentication & User Management:

User Roles: The system supports different roles like customers, employees (salespersons), branch supervisors, and admins.
Registration & Login: Users can register and log in using their email and password. JWT tokens are used for session management.
Optional Fingerprint Login: Employees can log in using a fingerprint scanner for quick access (optional).
3. Order Management:

Create Orders: Orders can be created by inputting items and quantities. Salespersons can also manually update the order status.
Order Statuses:
Completed: All items in the order are available for delivery.
Partial Fulfillment: Some items are unavailable, and the order is updated accordingly.
Refund: Customers can receive refunds if items are unavailable, with the refund processed using the original payment method or overridden to another mode.
Order Token/QR Code Validity: Token/QR codes are short-lived and cannot be reused after order completion. Branch supervisors can extend token validity in exceptional cases.
4. Product & Category Management:

Product Categories: Products are classified into categories. Admins or business owners can add, modify, or delete categories.
Favorite Products: Salespersons or customers can mark products as favorites for quick access.
Branch-Specific Product Availability: Branch supervisors control which products are available for sale at their branch.
Pricing Control: Branch supervisors can adjust prices for their branch, with changes tracked in audit logs.
Stock Tracking (optional): The system tracks stock availability for products across branches.
5. Payment Handling:

Payment Methods: Customers can pay using cash or UPI. If the selected payment method fails, it can be switched to another method.
Unique Payment QR Code: A unique QR code is generated for UPI payments, allowing the customer to scan and pay.
Refunds: Refunds are processed using the original payment method unless overridden by a salesperson or supervisor.
6. Customer Reviews & Ratings:

Optional Reviews: Customers can rate and review the service provided by the token and delivery counter staff after order fulfillment.
7. Multi-Branch Support:

Branch-Level Operations: Each branch operates independently, with branch-specific products, prices, and stock levels. However, customer data is shared across branches to help businesses identify returning customers.
Branch Supervisor Role: Branch supervisors control product visibility, pricing, and stock availability at their branch.
8. Scalability & Future Expansion:

MVP (Minimum Viable Product): The initial version supports a single business with multiple branches.
Phase 2 - Multi-Business Support: In future phases, the system will scale to support multiple businesses in a multi-tenant architecture, where each business manages its own branches and data.
API Integration: The system will provide APIs for external businesses to integrate with the POS platform in the future.
Real-Time Sync: Data such as orders, product availability, and stock levels will sync across all terminals in real-time within a branch.
9. Security & Audit Trails:

Role-Based Access Control: Users can only perform actions based on their roles (e.g., branch supervisors can manage products, employees can only manage orders).
Audit Logs: All critical actions like price changes, token extensions, and refunds are logged for security purposes.
10. Additional Features:

Self-Service Portal: Customers can place orders through a self-service portal and pay at any token counter. Orders placed this way will start processing once payment is completed.
Multi-Terminal Support: Multiple token and delivery counters can operate in parallel within the same branch.
Token Queue Management: The system helps customers locate the next available token counter in multi-terminal setups.
Tech Stack:
Backend: Node.js with Express.js, PostgreSQL for the database, Sequelize as the ORM, JWT for authentication.
Frontend: Flutter (or similar) for mobile/tablet interfaces.
Infrastructure: Docker for containerization, Docker Compose for managing services.
Real-Time Sync: WebSockets or Firebase for real-time updates
